# NEXIS-X React Tutorial

This is source code for that will be used for the React seminar put on by [NEXIS](http://nexis.ischool.syr.edu/) on Friday, Oct. 2nd at Syracuse University. The completed tutorial will be hosted in `public/js/solution.js` following the seminar.

## Using This Tutorial

You'll need to run a local webserver on your development machine to work with this tutorial. Make sure that you point your server to the `public/` directory as the root.

A couple options I recommend are:

**A) Express Server**

This repo comes complete with a simple Express server ready to go. You'll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed to get things going. Once you do, simply do the following:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Followed by:

```shell
$ npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:5000/

**B) MAMP**

[MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) is a great tool for running local servers on Mac or Windows computers via a GUI interface. You can download a free version online. You just need to point the root of the server to the `public/` directory and start it up. Then navigate to http://localhost:8888/
